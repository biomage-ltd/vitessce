import LiveViewConfigEditor from '../src/pages/_LiveEditor';

Try using the `VitessceConfig` class in the editor below and watch how the JSON output changes!

:::note
In this live editor we have already imported the required classes and functions. In practice you will need to import these yourself with the following line of code.

```js
import { VitessceConfig, hconcat, vconcat } from 'vitessce';
```
